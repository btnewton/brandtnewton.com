<p>This app was created in CS 275: Mobile Apps &amp; Embedded Devices for the Barre town forest. It was designed to assist forest users in navigating the various walking and biking trails, historic sites and Frisbee golf course. We chose to use Google Maps and SQLite so our app could be more easily ported to Android. This was completed in one semester.</p>
<p>I created the application's SQLite database, and a Python script to convert and insert the KML trail data into the database.</p>
<p>I was unhappy with what I learned during this Fall semester project, so I spent that Christmas break learning Android. This is when I began developing my <a class="swap-modal" href="#project-rational" data-dismiss="modal">dieting</a> and <a class="swap-modal" href="#project-repcheck">weight-lifting</a> apps.</p>
