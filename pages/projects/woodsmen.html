<p>Less than half a year after completing my first programming course (taught in MATLAB) I submitted this game, which is still a work in progress, to the 2013 UVM CS Fair. I followed a tutorial series to get the initial framework down and then optimized it and added features. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx_Gez6GuVU">This is a video of the submission.</a></p>
<p>Since the 2013 UVM CS Fair I have made some changes but it has never been my primary focus. I enjoy creating the graphics and coming up with new ways to increase the average FPS.</p>
